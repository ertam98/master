This is the code for my Master's thesis.

benchmark: The benchmark set from MIPLIB 2017 which contains 240 instances. (https://miplib.zib.de/)

benchmark-v2.txt: Text file with the namnes of all the instances in the benchmark set.

exponential_rewriter.py: Converts a problem from a ".mps.gz" file to the corresponding problem to find the analytical center using the exponential cone to a '.ptf.gz'.

geometric_mean_rewriter.py: Converts a problem from a ".mps.gz" file to the corresponding problem to find the analytical center using the geometric mean cone to a '.ptf.gz'.
